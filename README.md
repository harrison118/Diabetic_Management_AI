# Diabetic Management AI/Machine Learning

THe point of this project is to understand how an application could be built to track and try better gauge patterns for diabetics. The focus of the problem would be to try understand "what next?". The idea being that the entry of different factors such as injections, illness, food and excercise to name a few, all have the ability to affect ones glucose levels. By trying to create a solution (using what is already avaible in part, but trying to understand why they may miss the mark or not have worked for me). 

So if the problem is : Diabetes Management, the relative inpredicatble nature of it. 

Then the Goal is : To provide a Solution which can take in varying inputs such as Current Glucose level, Food Eaten, Injections Taken etc and use these along with previous entries to predict what the affect may be. 

The Objects to achieve this would be : 
- Be able to obtain glucose levels/Readings from Either a CGM device or Via user input
- Be able to access a food/Drink database such as that used by myFitnessPal and others. To allow easy entry of nutrional information of food. If not avaiable manual entry
- Be able to enter Excercise inputs based on type, duration and intensity.
- Be able to enter Injections as an input varying on type, amount and ..
- Be able to use a predictive pattern of X, to take in recorded inputs and access that against the current information entered/held to understand whats next. 
- All entries should be timestamped, this can be set to a prior date if not entered when intended, or will have a default timestamp (inc date) of current.
- All entries should be recorded, this will most likely have to be to a third party accessible database.

Note: This tool would be for assisting. And is reliant on accuracy from the user, to be truly effective. 

Ticket Order: 
- Choose the Language, Frameworks etc.

Phases: 
- Focus on user Input and Pulling from external Sources
- Information Storage
- Predictive Patterns
